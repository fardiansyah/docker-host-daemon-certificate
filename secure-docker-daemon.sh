# There are 2 ways to gain secure access to Docker daemon with TLS enabled
# 
# 1. Using the necessary options on the Docker client:
#
#     $ docker                       \
#         --tlsverify                \
#         --tlscacert=ca.pem         \
#         --tlscert=cert.pem         \
#         --tlskey=key.pem           \
#         -H localhost:2376 info
#
# 2. Using DOCKER environment variables:
#
# export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
# export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://0.0.0.0:2376"
# export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/home/fardiansyah/.docker"
